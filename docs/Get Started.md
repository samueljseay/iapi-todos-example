For this tutorial I've prepared a GitHub repository you can check out and follow along with the code and examples. 

This is a plugin scaffolded using the create-block tool. We can use wp-now to test it or you can mount it in your local `wp-env` or whatever other setup you use for Wordpress development.

* Step 1:  `git clone git@github.com:samueljseay/iapi-todos-example.git`
* Step 2: use the cli tool to get a starting setup: `pnpm step 1`
* Step 3: `pnpm i`
* Step 4: Mount the plugin in your local dev environment setup
* Step 5: Add the new block somewhere on your site.

From now on in the tutorial I'll refer to the Interactivity API as iapi for brevity!
